## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. FinRL Environment Compatibility
**Challenge**: Original minute-level data caused environment initialization errors
**Solution**: Created synthetic data generator and used hourly real data

### 2. Technical Indicator Integration
**Challenge**: Some indicators (ADX) not compatible with data format
**Solution**: Used DX-30 instead and validated indicator calculations

### 3. State Space Dimensionality
**Challenge**: Mismatch between expected and actual state dimensions
**Solution**: Properly calculated state space: balance + prices + shares + indicators
